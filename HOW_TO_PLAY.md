- **SPACE** - Pause/Unpause the game
- **ESC** - Return to menu or exit game
- **ENTER** - Start game, continue, or select menu options

### Movement Tips
- Movement is **grid-based** - you move one tile at a time

## 🎯 Game Objective

### Primary Goals
1. **Collect all pellets** (small dots) to advance to the next level
2. **Avoid ghosts** or you'll lose a life (you start with 3 lives)
3. **Survive through all 6 levels** to complete the game
4. **Achieve the highest score possible**

### Scoring System
- **Pellets**: 10 points each
- **Power-pellets**: 50 points each
- **Ghosts** (when frightened): 200 → 400 → 800 → 1600 points in sequence

## ⚡ Power-Pellet Mechanics

### What are Power-Pellets?
- **Large dots** found in maze corners
- **Activate "Frightened Mode"** for all ghosts
- Turn ghosts **blue and vulnerable** for a limited time

### How to Use Power-Pellets Strategically
1. **Save them** for when multiple ghosts are nearby
2. **Eat ghosts in sequence** for maximum points (200→400→800→1600)
3. **Time your usage** - frightened mode doesn't last forever
4. **Use for escape** when cornered by multiple ghosts

## 👻 Understanding Ghost Behavior

### Ghost Personalities

#### 🔴 Blinky (Red Ghost)
- **Behavior**: Direct aggressive pursuit
- **Strategy**: Most dangerous - avoid direct confrontation
- **Tip**: Use corners and tunnels to break line of sight

#### 🩷 Pinky (Pink Ghost)  
- **Behavior**: Ambush tactics - targets 4 tiles ahead of you
- **Strategy**: Unpredictable movement patterns
- **Tip**: Change direction frequently to confuse targeting

#### 🟠 Clyde (Orange Ghost)
- **Behavior**: Switches between chase and scatter randomly
- **Strategy**: Sometimes helpful, sometimes dangerous
- **Tip**: Don't rely on consistent behavior

#### 🩵 Inky (Cyan Ghost)
- **Behavior**: Complex positioning relative to other ghosts
- **Strategy**: Most unpredictable movement
- **Tip**: Watch for coordinated attacks with other ghosts

### Ghost Modes

#### 🔍 Scatter Mode
- Ghosts move to their **corner territories**
- **Safer time** to collect pellets
- Happens in **timed intervals**

#### 🎯 Chase Mode  
- Ghosts actively **hunt the player**
- Each ghost uses its **unique personality**
- **More dangerous** - stay alert!

#### 😨 Frightened Mode (Blue Ghosts)
- Triggered by **eating power-pellets**
- Ghosts become **vulnerable and edible**
- Move **slower and randomly**
- **Limited duration** - act fast!

#### 💀 Eaten Mode
- Ghost returns to **spawn point**
- **Temporarily harmless**
- Will **respawn** after reaching home

## 💡 Advanced Strategy Tips

### Pellet Collection
- **Plan your route** to avoid getting trapped
- **Clear safe areas first** when ghosts are in scatter mode
- **Save difficult pellets** for when you have power-pellets nearby

### Power-Pellet Timing
- **Count ghosts** before using - more ghosts = more points
- **Position yourself** near multiple ghosts before eating
- **Chain ghost consumption** quickly for maximum score multiplier

### Survival Tactics
- **Use tunnels** to escape dangerous situations
- **Learn ghost patterns** - they're predictable in chase mode
- **Stay near power-pellets** when surrounded
- **Corner cutting** - ghosts can't cut corners as sharply as you

### High Score Strategies
- **Perfect power-pellet usage** - always eat 4 ghosts per power-pellet
- **Efficient routing** - minimize backtracking
- **Risk management** - know when to retreat vs. push forward
- **Mode timing** - use scatter mode for risky pellet collection

## 🎮 Game Progression

### Level Structure
